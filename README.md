# PersonalSite

Personal website that I created to test my skills in Angual Typescript after a couple of weeks of training with it. This was to push myself in a language and a framework I was unfamiliar with in order to learn it in my own time.

This app uses node_modules with bootstrap 3.

# What I Learned

* How to connect components together and do styling of a website.
* Create a couple of basic games and understand how to connect a website to another site.
* Learn to use the Angular framework as well as learn to code in Typescript.
